        - Imaging (ala Planet)
        - Analyzing weather patterns etc.
    - Providing internet connectivity
        - low bandwidth, high latency internet to places that don't have very good internet access

    - How will the cost of earth-based satellite production change over time?


- Satellites are useful
    - What are the current largest uses of satellites?
    - What are the biggest potential uses of satellites?
    - Value/use of near-earth orbit vs geostationary vs far away


- What a satellite is may be very different over time
    - There are a few vectors that could determine

- Would mega structures far larger than conventional satellites be useful for something?
    - Construction of very long fiber-optic cables (one of the few things possibly worth the cost/kilo to bring back to earth)
