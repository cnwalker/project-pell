# Goals
- To allow for the creation of autonomous/semi-autonomous factories in earth orbit

- Factories must be capable of producing
    - Micro satellites (Cubesats)
    - Large satellites
    - Other factories (?)

# Why
- What are the current largest problems on earth that space-based production could help address?


- Satellite production is currently very expensive
    - How expensive?
    - What are the various components of cost?
    - How will the cost of earth-based satellite production change over time?


- Satellites are useful
    - What are the current largest uses of satellites?
    - What are the biggest potential uses of satellites?
    - Value/use of near-earth orbit vs geostationary vs far away


- What a satellite is may be very different over time
